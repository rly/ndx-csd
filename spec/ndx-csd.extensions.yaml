    doc: Description of the current source density analysis, including how it was
      computed.

      as opposed to virtual electrode locations (where interpolation is used to compute
      the CSD at the virtual locations).

    doc: Description of what an electrode location of 0 (or (0,0) or (0,0,0)) represents,
      e.g., most superior point of a linear probe, or most posterior and most left
      point of a 2D array. This value should also describe what a positive value in
      each dimension represents, e.g., +x is superior.
